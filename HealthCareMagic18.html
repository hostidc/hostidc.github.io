In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms.

            "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. I hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,"

You are getting bouts of pain in the upper abdomen within the last 2 years particularly after the gall bladder surgery.

Alternatively, you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status.

            "output": "Hello, I can understand your concern for abnormal blood report.1) Your symptom of loose motion might be due to indigestion. There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!"

In hot and humid climate, most likely this is Emilia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled), this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath). If itchy, I used to give calamine lotion and antihistamine like levocetirizine for few days.

Masturbation cannot make you sick or unhealthy. It is natural and even animals do it. In saying that you started masturbation at the age of 8 is a bit exaggerating. Puberty is attained after around 11. Masturbation before that cannot produce the desired result. Secondly, Masturbation cannot make you thin. But the anxiety associated with it can make you thin. If you are able to take proper nutritious and healthy food, then you should not be thin. Inspire, if you are thin, either you have some anxiety disorders or some wasting diseases like anemia.

The infected stool must be submitted to a lab that has the special equipment and appropriately trained personnel in order to detect amoebic dysentery disease.

Explained Answer -The vast majority of lower back pain cases get better within six weeks without surgery, and lower back pain exercises are almost always part of a treatment plan. If pain persists or worsens, more involved diagnostic and surgical procedures may be recommended.  Medications : A wide variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications is available to help reduce symptoms of lower back pain. Many medications reduce inflammation, which is often a cause of pain, while others work to inhibit the transmission of pain signals from reaching the brain. Each medication has multiple unique risks, possible side effects and Chat Doctor. Also, I would suggest Rest for some time more because Ceasing activity for a few days allows injured tissue and even nerve roots to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve lower back pain.

When the doctor performed the laparoscopy, I would think that they would have done a test at the same time to see if the fallopian tubes were all right or not.

If your periods are regular, and you have monthly cycles, it would mean that you are ovulating, and that would mean a good chance of pregnancy as well.

Since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. I don't know any therapy named KELLEY, but I suppose you are talking about ch elation therapy. This therapy is of no benefit for the patient. The blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. Medications can only help to stop progression of the block. Definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. Had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? Bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. Patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery.

            "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. There are two possibilities of what could be going on with your pregnancy. If you really did conceive back in October, your pregnancy should be about 12 weeks. This would have been found on the ultrasound examination that you had, but instead the fetus measured only five weeks three days. At five weeks it is not normal to see fetal heartbeat so that is not used in the consideration to make a diagnosis. However, it is possible that you conceived later in the cycle after your. In October. If you actually conceived in late November early December it is still possible that the fetus could be viable and that is just younger than it should be by your dates. So the way to tell the difference would be to get another ultrasound examination and approximately two weeks; by then you should see some evidence of the fetal heartbeat if the pregnancy is normal. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of women do not have pregnancy symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle.

Pregnancy tests are designed to pick up the hormone Chat Doctor from that whicChatDoctores out in your urine.

So I would advise, in your situation, that you repeat the ultrasound examination in another 2 to 3 weeks.

            "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. The spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. There might be pressure on the discs in the dorsal and lumbar spine and this is causing slight pressure on the spinal canal at a particular level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in the area supplied by the nerve. The disc problem which had involved the T 12 - L 1 disc might have affected the discs at other levels also. Besides, you also have fused vertebrae at lumbar levels. As your symptoms are on the right it is possible that the nerve roots on the right side are affected. You require to be examined a neurologist and an MRI of the dorsal and lumbar spine if indicated to know if the nerve are under pressure and the location. There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections are also given for relief. However, this might not always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the cervical neck region. Presently, laser assisted surgical techniques are also available. If the pain is mild then it appears to be a minor problem that is treatable. Please do not worry."

In every case, antibiotic therapy may be required, so test should be done as soon as possible so that appropriate treatment can be started. Till that try to Chat Doctor.

Scientific studies show that when clinic composite (containing albuterol) is given together with item (containing ipratropium bromide), the results are better compared to clinic composite alone. Therefore, you can give both preparations together, 2-4 times a day because they will not harm your baby but at the contrary, will help him. Also, you should find a solution for the chest infection, by changing the type of antibiotic for example, in close contact with your doctor, because it is a cause of your babies cough.

Since you have stones in the kidney, liver and spleen, you will need to do thyroid function tests to rule out hypercalcinosis, which is a condition in which there is above normal levels of calcium in the blood, which can lead to stone formation in various organs. If hypercalcinosis is detected, then it will need to be treated. Liver and spleen stones don't need to be treated.

            "output": "Hi. Thanks for your query. Read your history and understood the problem. It is good that you had been diagnosed and well treated for Tuberculosis of abdomen. Since you were asymptomatic for last year the chances of an active TB of abdomen is remote. The probable causes for belatedness and tightness of your abdomen can be: Intestinal sub-acute intestinal obstruction due to stricture formation of intestine; this is quite common sequel. Can be a mild gastroenteritis. I would advise you the following. X-ray of the abdomen in standing position. This is the cheapest and simplest test to see for intestinal obstruction. Ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen to confirm. Routine tests of blood and urine. Enterocolitis if obstruction is suspected, Diagnostic Laparoscopy: this helps in diagnosis and well as therapeutically. One can cut the bands / release the adhesions. Take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole for 5 days, is there is a response, nothing to worry. - Maintain healthy food habits, avoid too many fibrous foods as they can cause repeated sub-acute intestinal obstructions. If no relief further investigations and treatment will be required."

            "output": "Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor. Breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for that. Lactose or any other formula, is cow milk based and difficult to digest for the baby. So, in such a condition, the baby often vomits it out. Try not to go for formula feeds and go for breastfeeding as far as you can. You may express your breast milk and store it in a refrigerator before you bring it to the normal temperature and give to the baby. In case of breastfeeding, insert the entire nipple along with the areola (not only the nipple) in the babies mouth. Feed one breast at a time and alternate breasts with each feed. Breast milk is produced as per the demands of the baby as express through the suckling. In case of formula feeding, the hunger of the baby is reduced, and the baby suckles less automatically reducing the amount of breast milk produced. So, reduce formula feeds as far as you can. The adequacy of the feeds would be expressed with the amount of urine passed. Passing urine at least 5-6 times in 24 hours is to be considered adequate. Hope that helps.

Sgot is found in liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in DECREASING disorder of concentration. Sgpt is mainly found in the liver. I want to explain to you that any mild disease or any injury to above-mentioned organs may be responsible for high level of GOT. While primarily Sept is in liver, so any cell injury to liver cells may be responsible for liver disease. But this level is not so high so at present need not worry, if you didn't have any other symptoms. Keep regular watch over liver function tests and symptoms. Besides avoid wine, Chat Doctor. Still if you have any doubt get in MRI and ultrasound of liver. Consult a physician and get his opinion as physical examination is also important. Good luck."

Coming to the growth part, you are already 38yrs old, at this age there won't be any growth in your body parts. Only thing what can be done is asked your dentist to prepare another set of dentures which are of your size not huge and size of the teeth should be reduced, and your occlusion should be checked thoroughly and extensions of the dentures are important so that you won't end up in gag reflexes anymore.

We talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology. As you explain, you have done all the examinations, and they result normal. According to this, we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life long. If you tell that you still have high blood pressure values despite your treatment, it means that you have to rise your medication to better control your blood pressure. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend a holder pressure monitoring for 24 h, to know your mean values. After that if they result high I will add another medicament or rise the dosage of your existing ones. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards."

            "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment differs in every patient depending on the location, size, staging and post surgery biopsy findings. Since you have had surgery only 9 days ago, it will help to discuss with your oncologist and depending on the biopsy report, go for a comprehensive treatment. Even is the margins are clear, there is estrogen/ progesterone positive nature and this requires you to have chemotherapy and radiation. The earliest this is started the best outcome it will have. I wish you reconsider the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation in your case and start treatment on time. Naturopathy can give you comfort and detoxify your system, and it is best to discuss your treating doctor on when to take simple naturopathy procedures and wait until you are done with initial chemotherapy. Even if the margins are clear, there can still be persisting microscopic invasion of cells and this can lead to flaring of cancer an few months.

However, my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position, before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.?",
            "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. However, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. However, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. Regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. If you are considering having a version, I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,"

It can be due to male or female causes or due to a combination. In terms of your partner, you are right in assuming that he would need a semen analysis. The cost would vary according to one lab to the next. He can either consider speaking to his urologist, speaking to a lab directly to find out the cost. In terms of your investigations, your doctor would need to assess the different aspect of the reproductive system-the uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervixThis would involve both imaging and blood tests. You should consider visiting your gynecologist or a fertility specialist. Even if issues are found with either of you there are effective techniques available that may be able to help you conceive.

As per your complaint it is possible that if the margins of the crown is not intact and there is a gap between crown and tooth, water and food debris along with bacteria can seep into the tooth and leads to secondary Infection. In this case if the decay has not reached the nerves present in the center of tooth then you may not have pain, but the tooth can continue to decay. If this is the case you will have to get the crown removal, get the tooth filled or Root Canal treatment has to be done followed by replacing the crown.

Usually snakes are non poisonous. But if snakes are poisonous usually its either cardio toxic or neurotoxic & sometimes both. Swelling doe snot confirms that the snake was toxic, but it needs attention further. Although it's rare that toxin will show its action after 15 days but until the swelling subsides u need to be kept on watch. 4 views of antivenom may not be sufficient if knowledgeable symptoms appear, & if no symptoms appear, you may not need anti venom at all, but for that you should be kept in watch for at least three days. Even if just swelling appears its considered safe to administer antivenom, some patient body react to antivenom and can't be continued further. I don't think you are in trouble of having activation of toxin but still you should keep watch on yourself for following things until the swelling subsides.1) If either or both eyelids starts Chat Doctor. 2) or if you develop numbness (decrease/loss of sensation on touch.) 3)Any kind of unnatural bleeding from nose or in stool etc. If any of above complaints develop then It's must revisit ER.

            "input": "I ve been experiencing bouts of severe abdominal pain over the past 7 months and admitted to the hospital four times. I ve been given different diagnoses of diverticulitis , irritable bowel , typhlitis and colities. The pain initially presented on my right side and also intermittently included back pain. The stomach pain on a scale of 1-10 is usually 7-8. I ve had an ultrasound, a abdominal CT scan with and without contrast, an EGD, a HIDA scan and most recently a colonoscopy and I m scheduled for a CT scan with and without contrast with a pancreatic window. My History: 49 year old African American female, 5 2 , 220lbs (lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months). I currently take cardizem cd 120mg, losartan 50mg, ferrous sulfate 325 twice a day, protonix 40mg, singulair at night and just finished 500mg of levoquin after my last hospital stay July 21-23. I had H Pylori back in 1989, had my gall bladder removed in 2006, had ovarian masses/tumors removed in 2008 along with a complete historectomy. I also have a mass and cysts on my right kidney (which I was informed was perfectly harmless--been there since 2008). My last 2 hospital stays were because of hypertension, heart palpitations, tightness in my chest, headaches, sweats, pains in the left arm, lightheaded/dizziness. Tests showed a normal EKG, but some tachycardia. The EGD showed a hiatal hernia and a growth that was sent out for a biopsy. Lab reports showed among other things, anemia. The ct scan showed typhlitis , whatever that is. The colonoscopy showed stenotic ileocecal valve. The doctors have come to a concensus...they don t know what it is. Here are the majority of the pieces of the puzzle, any light you can shed would be greatly appreciated.",
            "output": "Hi MEANS, Welcome to Chat Doctor ! Your problem is really very complex. So many possible causes are there. Two of your medicines need to be switched, Singular needs to be stopped you can take other inhalations anti-asthmatic which are equally effective, You are taking excessive doses of iron- I would suggest 100\u00a0mg thrice a day after meals, which is most tolerated dose. You might have post-surgical bands which result in intermittent obstruction and pain, that is more so a case if you are totally well in between the episodes. Another prominent possibilities is tuberculosis of abdomen. If your problem does not get resolved soon please review with your gastro-surgeon, and possibly you would need an exploratory laparotomy for a diagnosis and intraoperative intervention if possible. You need a physical examination by your physician and get baseline investigations like Chest X-Ray, Electrocardiogram, Complete Blood Counts, Renal Function Test, Liver Function Test, Fasting and Postprandial Blood Sugar, Thyroid Profile, Lipid Profile, Ultrasound Abdomen, Urine Compete Examination. This work up is expected to detect the underlying problem, so a definite treatment could be started.  I hope this advice would be helpful for you.

When I attended clinic I was told I wouldn t need an X-ray as they were certain from my original X-ray that I hadn t broken anything, to take my cast off & get it moving again. I mentioned I had a numbness and pins & needles in my thumb but that was put down to the cast I d had on. One week later, I still have a numbness/pins & needles in my thumb & my wrist continues to ache/throb. Is this normal or do I need to go back & be seen again? I don t want to waste anyone s time.",
            "output": "Dear patient, a needles and pins sensation is generally due to a nerve compression/irritation. If it wasn't due to the cast (that's a possibility), probably your trauma provoked a hematoma pressing on a nerve (median nerve? Collateral nerve of the thumb? It depends on numbness distribution). I propose to wait a month from the trauma. If this sensation persist, get an electromyography/electroneurography to objective the nerve injury. If positive, do an RMN of wrist and hand to understand the cause (i.e. hematoma) and project its possible removal. Concerning instead your doubt about a scaphoid fracture, I don't know which X-ray projections you did (scaphoid fractures are hard to be seen in standard X-rays). However, if your wrist remained very painful for 10-15 days after the trauma, a scaphoid X-ray projection or, better, a wrist CT, would solve your doubts"

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

            "output": "Hello and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your Implant was removed. Implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. So if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. So, I suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your Implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time.

            "output": "Cushing's disease itself can cause elevated WBC, so this may not necessarily be related to an infection. Certainly a year of antibiotics should have taken care of most infections, depending on what antibiotic was used. Unusual infections or internal infections (e.g., abscess in a muscle or organ) might cause a persistent elevated WBC, as might a chronic inflammatory condition. You would probably be having other symptoms, such as persistent fevers, pain, or weight loss, if that were the case. You don't say how high the WBC count is, so it is hard to assess its severity.  Be sure the Cushing disease is well treated first. If you are still having elevated WBC, you might need further evaluation or need to see a hematologist to get a specific diagnosis. Hope this helps."

It was a conservative surgey. Do i need a chemotherapy? What is the survival rate with and without chemo. 5 year survival rate means the person only has 5 years to live?",
            "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to take chemotherapy for dysgerminoma after surgery. Stage 1 requires only surgery because it is immature teratoma. However, higher stage is best treated with chemotherapy. Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carbonation and topside. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease and prevent recurrence. Recurrence takes place in few patients even after surgery. That is why probably your doctors have recommended chemotherapy. With chemotherapy survival rates are high in the early stages. Almost every patient will respond to treatment. In cancer survival 5 year is considered a benchmark for treatment. If a patient survives for 5 years then their cancer is considered treated. Patients can live for a lifetime. Please do not worry."

As you are wearing orthodontic braces for teeth alignment, your teeth will take new position due to it root movements.Therefore, it is best to go for gum grafts only after that.

If your heart rate is persistently high, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of reducing the dose of Adderall. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing good health, "

            "output": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint a dark purple lump next to molar tooth can be due to a dilated vein also known as Varicose vein or a Varix. The lump might be due to formation of a small blood clot that got lodged in that area forming a Thrombus. It is not AA serious condition and will not cause any serious problem. It can gradually reduce in size on its own. If it is not ruled out as the cause other causes can be like mucous cyst or Muscle, Hematoma or a Hematoma. Confirmation can be done by getting a clinical evaluation done by an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. "

Hip and upper thigh pain which is of burning nature and is occurring more in sitting position especially in obese individuals (as in your case) is suggestive of NEURALGIA PARENTHETICAL. This condition results due to the compression of Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (pinched nerve) at the level of groin fold. A few conservative measures which are effective in treating this condition includes - wearing loose clothing (avoiding tightness at the level of the waist and groin fold), Losing weight, taking OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin, Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the legs and buttocks etc. Other causes arising from the Hip joint are also to be excluded by having X-rays and MRI scans, which may also present with similar picture. So, I suggest you to consult an orthopedic surgeon for a detailed clinical examination and further management. Hope this information is helpful. Good day"

            "output": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Rabies is 100% fatal, but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment and this is transmitted by dog bite. As your daughter was bitten by a vaccinated dog over the lip which has led to bleeding from the site, according to WHO it is categorized into Cat III. Even it is a vaccinated dog you need to doubly check whether it is properly and completely vaccinated, because the bite is on the lip which is closer to the brain and the virus can ascend easily and reach the brain and can affect it. So I would suggest you to take 1. Active immunization with antirabies vaccine on days 0,3,7,14 and 28.2. Passive immunization with Rigs around the wound.3. Oral antibiotic like Tab Augmenting, twice daily4. Topical Tract ointment.Don't take any risk with this disease, I would suggest your daughter to take aforementioned treatment. Thank you."

Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. I hope I have answered you query.

To a point, they are genetically determined and are found in many people as they age. They are accelerated by factors affecting blood vessels such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etcetera. So the only thing that can be done to slow down this process is checking for the presence of those factors and ad Chat Doctor. As for the mild volume loss that means the mild shrinking of the brain.

            "output": "Hi and thanks for the question, Chronic elevation of the ABCs deserves a more critical evaluation. In your case especially, the association with increased ESR, fatigue and petechial suggest exclusion of a bone marrow malignancy, especially a leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy might be compelling. Secondly, I would to suggest carrying out Anti-nuclear antibodies, HLA27 and autism antibodies for your symptoms are also very compatible with systemic lupus erythematous, which is an autoimmune disease. The symptoms as I said are very suggestive of a leukemia. An appropriate diagnosis is critical, for the setting up of an appropriate treatment plan. Delayed diagnoses my make the prognosis more faint. I suggest you book an appointment with the hematologist, to rule out a leukemia or any possible blood malignancy, and possibly systemic lupus erythematous. Thanks for your question and hope this helps, Luchuo, MD."

Psoriasis in the body folds responds very well to topical steroids as well as topical immunomodulators like tacrolimus/pimecrolimus ointment.

When the motility consistently falls below 25 percent, the chances of a problem are much higher. When the motility consistently falls below five to 10 percent, the chances that fertility is normal is highly unlikely.

Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness.

            "output": "Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical Musculoskeletal assessment is advised.a little knowledge about the fibromyalgia is needed. Fibromyalgia is a condition where the pain is in the fibers of the muscle. Each muscle is composed of multiple muscle fibers and inflammation happening there will lead to the dysfunction in the circuiting of the muscle fibers to produce the contraction and relaxation. Also to understand here that the medication is a symptomatic relief and not a long term solution as the body is a medicine of its own and medication used acts as a supportive therapy to allow body to heal on its own. Also, in my clinical practice most Fibromyalgia cases we recommend physical therapy, meditation and breathing exercises. As physical therapy will help improve the muscle refunctioning and also improve the metabolism and immune system to reduce the inflammation. Also, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy have been useful to reduce the pain, but importantly exercises are the choice. Meditation helps improve the control over the anxiety and leads to cooling of aggression. Breathing exercises helps to improve the oxygen carrying blood cells which acts as a fuel in the metabolism and reduce the metabolic waste as well. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. "

            "output": "Blushing is a common reaction. It may be a part of social anxiety disorder or social phobia. If blushing, sweating, along with possibly tremors or stuttering occur when you are in a social situation; you may seek the help of a psychiatrist. The other features of social phobia which you may be having are:1) Fear that people will evaluate you/ judge you negatively when you are in a social situation. Such fears are more likely in public speaking, talking to a crowd, or meeting many people at a party or social gathering.2) Many people have symptoms described in 1) above. But they should be severe enough to cause limitations in your functioning. Or you find the anxiety so severe that you avoid situations completely. This then leads to further social problems.3) You think this fear is excessive, but seem to have no control over it. There are medications as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) for dealing with social anxiety. The disorder is sometimes almost a part of your personality, that it stays throughout life. However, medications or psychotherapy will help you deal effectively with the symptoms. Do seek a psychiatrists' opinion on it."

But if you feel that she does not have wheezing, you may skip giving it and reserve if for times of respiratory distress, if it occurs. The side effect of Ventolin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects. Give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and I think that she would get some relief. Also add some antiallergic syrup like Relent which will also help in diluting the cough.

It could be an allergy which increases with weather changes, dust, exposure to sun, certain plants, animals etc. Also, certain foods like nuts, seafood, processed foods, etc. You will need to keep a track of when exactly the rashes come up and if there is a common cause each time. Allergies generally reduce as the child grows, but repeated exposure to the cause can make it recur often. Use a mild sunscreen when outside. When rashes appear, apply a demonize cream on the face for 5- 7 days till rash subsides, no longer. Use an antihistamine like HY Chat Doctor.

            "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You had choking and aspiration of food particles in trachea. Your symptoms are associated with eating. So by mistake when we aspirate food particles in trachea (wind pipe), it gets blocked. Due to this, we can not get air and hence we feel breathlessness. During this episode our body is deprived of oxygen and so black out is seen. To overcome this, violent coughing (reflex) is done by the body to cough put food particle. Once food particles are out, wind pipe is open, and you can breathe normally. So better to chew properly while swallowing. Do not speak much while eating. Hope I have solved your query.

Very concerned and would appreciate some advice.",
            "output": "Hi there,Tetras is an antibiotic which is not recommended to be taken in pregnancy, but it is not known to cause any major defect in the baby if taken during the first trimester. Studies have shown that it effects the baby if taken after 4 months of pregnancy, causing the babies teeth to be discolored and can cause hardening and cause excess calcification of teeth and bones which is irreversible. But, since you are exposed to tetracycline at such an early gestation it is very unlikely to have affected your baby. Only minor abnormalities are known to occur in few women. Do not be overly concern and get a NT scan at 11 weeks and an anomaly scan done at 20 weeks to check for anomaly. Hope this helps. Regards."

On your description - not painful, hanging (which I assume you mean not firmly attached but mobile) and the recent onset - I can tell that there is no likelihood of serious infection or dental cyst/tumor. It could be a granuloma or a papilloma. All conditions are self regressing and you don't have to worry. Try not to disturb it though, and if you develop signs of infection (reddening, fluid discharge, multiple sores in mouth etc.) get it attended immediately.

            "output": "Hi and pleased to answer you. Throughout pregnancy, the fetus bathes in a translucent pouch that gradually fills with amniotic fluid until the 35th week of amenorrhea where the amount of fluid is at its maximum with about 980 ml. Then the amniotic fluid decreases to the end to reach a volume between 600 and 800 ml approximately. The flow of the amniotic fluid signals the rupture of the membrane, and the risk of premature delivery if the term of the pregnancy is not reached. When the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally low compared to the term of pregnancy, it is called oligoamnios. During oligoamnios, infection rate is higher. The premature rupture of the membranes (rupture before the beginning of the work) concerns 5 to 10% of the pregnancies. Its risk factors are the same as those of spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This patient received a punch on her abdomen, which caused a premature rupture of the membranes and then a loss of the entirety amniotic fluid then an oligoamnios was created, and during the 2 weeks before the hospitalization, there was infection of the genital and baby components and infection dissemination by haematogenous route Causing endocarditis. Sorry for your daughter and may god has his soul in peace."

If you cannot read the urine test properly, you should go for the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles along with a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the issue. The spotting could possibly be due to an implantation bleed, but, it needs to be clarified.

This is caused as the baby with the sac in early pregnancy is too small to fill up whole of the uterus. The exposed inner lining of uterus may degenerate and bleed just like a normal menstrual cycle. I am assuming that your ultrasonography after the gush of bleeding showed a live baby with evidence of fetal heart beat. In that case chance of abortion is minimal.

He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guideance about the fluid. Thank you in advance.",
            "output": "HIT hanks for your query. If there is no active peritoneal dialysis going on, then the abdominal fluid collection is unlikely to be related to the Peritoneal dialysis catheter. Ascites or fluid in the peritoneal cavity can be due to a weak heart or liver problems. I would recommend a 2D Echocardiogram, Ultrasound of the abdomen and a diagnostic ascetic fluid tap. Based on the results we could make further recommendations. Hope this helps Good luck."

Is this all normal? I m 21 and haven t had a tooth removed since I was 5 and it s kind of freaking me out that my mouth hurts this bad still since its been 5 days.

            "output": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, As you have mentioned the first molar you got extracted was involved with abscess. So after extraction the socket needs to be curetted to remove the pus pocket and all the debris and irritants, disinfection of the socket is done, and then the wound is packed with cotton gauze .any remnants of abscessed tissue in the socket may lead to infection and pain. Secondly you may have developed a condition of Chat Doctor.  You need to get it clinically examined by a dentist to confirm and make a diagnosis. Pain the other teeth may be due to gingival infection which can be cured by scaling and root planing. About wisdom teeth, they normally erupt at the age of 18 to 27 years, so you can still wait as you will get the eruption signs once they appear. I would suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done which will show the wisdom tooth appearing as well as infection in other teeth if any, will help in deciding treatment. I hope I answered all your doubts, take care."

            "output": "Hello, There could be a few reasons to your symptoms. Since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. From you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. Language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere, so speaking would also be difficult. You didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an MR-Angiogram (blood vessel imaging with MRI) or CT-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a CT) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. If neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. Alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. They are very rare, but still a possibility. The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again, I feel that that is less likely. None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to a Chat Doctor.  You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Kristoffer Mission"

This needs to be done on a daily basis. Other remedy is Comic acid cream which lightens up the dark spots but takes some time. However, mellow is a facial treatment using Vitamins and Mineral injections to add that healthy glow to skin which radiates energy and vitality. Subdermal vitamin injections rejuvenate the cells, making them more active and thereby stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Overall it reduces dark spots; effects seen faster than comic acid. You can continue same treatment for dark spots along with natural remedies and sunscreen creams. Take care. Best regards,"

I am advised to take hormonal tablets (Conest). I am very much worried and really hoping the best for my baby. Can you please tell me how much possibility is there for a fetal heartbeat and fetaql pole after 10 days. Thanks in advance.",
            "output": "Hallow Dear, Usually by 6 weeks or so the fetal pole and fetal cardiac activity is detectable by ultrasound. If by 7 weeks, it is undetectable, there are following possibilities:1. The ovulation and conception might have occurred late in the menstrual cycle, which otherwise happens 14 days before the next menstrual period.2. There could be mistake in calculating the duration of pregnancy.3. The pregnancy could be without embryo (baby). This is known as blighted ovum. In such case, the ultrasonography image shows corrugated margins of the sac. If the margins of the sac are well-rounded, in order to exclude the first two causes, it is a good option to repeat the scan after a week to 10 days. If still the sac is empty, then the diagnosis of blighted ovum is confirmed. However, if the edges are corrugated, it is blighted ovum. Pregnancies with blighted ovum do not grow. If such pregnancy does not abort spontaneously, termination is the requirement. I hope this helps you. "

If you have any mental disorders, you cannot do so. You must add to your self-confidence. What you can do now is, understand what life is. Even you are a guest here. Your spouse went because his time had come. When your time comes, you shall also join him. That is life. Depression is normal, but we should overcome our emotions. Everybody, every human being does. Then why not you? If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe some psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck."

            "output": "Hi and welcome, Finger sucking and thumb sucking habit is very injurious as dental health is concerned. Although thumb sucking is a normal habit it causes serious teeth problems if it continues long after the eruption of permanent teeth.  Prolonged finger sucking can create crowded, crooked teeth and bite problems.  You may also develop speech problems or problems with swallowing properly.  Protrusion and displacement of front teeth are usual results of thumb sucking. This can affect your facial appearance and cause further emotional problems. You can follow few steps to avoid the habit :Ask your family member to carefully remove your fingers from mouth during sleep Don't be in anxiety or fear. If you have any emotional problems, or under stress, and you need comforting, you may need to resolve those issues first before successfully stopping the habit.  Use a finger sucking guard. - your dentist might suggest the use of special devices to stop thumb sucking, called finger guards. A finger or thumb guard is a device with a plastic cover of the thumb that is attached to wrist. . Treatment with thumb guards usually lasts four weeks and helps to stop thumb sucking successfully. I hope this helps, take care"

            "output": "Hello, As you met an accident where you were diagnosed with biceps retinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis I wonder why the shoulder functions have not resumed even after 6 months. Have you taken an MRI of the shoulder? If so what was the reports? If not then please do take it. I suspect this to be a rotator cuff injury. Because any injury happening to the shoulder with two muscle injury falls in the group. The rotator cuff muscles are weak. You need to work out behind it. Shoulder function can resume only when we have good range of motion in passive for all the movements and also if we overcome the pain.  In fact, I should share one of the rotator cuff injury cases of mine. It was a case of 65 years old female with the above-mentioned injury. No passive or active shoulder movements. But to overcome the problems, I use to make the muscle tire by active ROM exercises and no weights. Just gravity assisted and gravity resisted ones. In fact all the shoulder movements like - flexion, extension, rotation, abduction, adduction and circumduction. At the end of the 12th week, she had the best movements without any kind of pain and shoulder was much stronger than before. I will advise you to look for a competitive physiotherapist who can help you get the best outcome score. If left untreated it will lead to other pathologies which are not accepted.

With in 4 days the lump was the size of a hockey puck and extremely painful. They did surgery to remove it, but didn t take it out 2x s. Once before a mri and petscan, and once after, but both times they just sewed him back up and said if they removed it, they would be doing more damage than the tumor. He says he has a non-cell malignancy. He told me today it is stage 4 melanoma. He is in his 4th week of daily radiation, but he said that he has been told he is inoperable, uncurable, but manageable. He originally told me that the tumor was solo, and not attached to anything when he had an ultrasound, but 4 days later when they did the 2nd surgery it has wrapped itself around things in his neck. What kind of cancer does this? Is he terminal?He lives in another state and I think he is keeping information from me to spare my feelings?",
            "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. This is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. What happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. When there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. Since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. The lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. Doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. It is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. Please do not worry."

Treatment of underlying cause will relieve the symptoms. As of now, you can start gargling with a numbing mouthwash containing Lidocaine to relieve the symptoms.

            "output": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You must know that Adderall is a stimulant of central nervous system. It affects chemicals in the brain that contributes to hyper reactivity. Through stimulation of nervous system in a secondary way it stimulates the electrical system of the heart. This stimulation might cause fast heart beats over 100 or generate other electrical impulses in parts of the heart different from normal sinus Rhythm. This causes premature heart contraction that we call extra systolic beats. In this situation you feel your heart like running, making pauses or skipping beats. You might feel anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply, palpitations or pulsations to your veins all over. Every kind of stimulation of nervous system might cause this rhythm issue to simple emotional stress, coffee consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism, this kind of medicine that act directly to the system. So, nothing serious is happening to your heart. it's a reaction to this stimulation. My opinions is to discuss this effects with your doctor and decide together what to do with and fit is possible or allowed to stop it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards."

The best option is to monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography and time your sexual intercourse on the day of egg release. You will have to submit for the ultrasonography day 9 onwards for about 5-6 days. This should give you better results.

When I run my fingers along my spine, I do notice a slight protrusion at the source of the pain -- I m not sure if it can be seen, but I can feel it. I don t have any serious history of either back or muscle issues. I do feel quite restless when sitting down -- I am constantly shifting. I also get the urge to crack my back at least two to three times per day. Any ideas about the pain in the one spot of my spine? Why is it sticking out? Thanks!",
            "output": "Hello ! I understand your concern. In my opinion a disc bulge in that level of your column may be the cause of these symptoms. The protrusion may be an inflammatory lesion, or just the bone related with your spinal nerves at the point of the column where they get out from the spine. Other possible diagnosis, more rare may be lesions of the spine like tumors, cysts, etc. I would recommend you see a doctor and have a lumbar column x-ray and a blood routine test to rule out this diagnosis.

Usually it is nothing serious, however if it starts recurring, some diagnostics is necessary. Swollen gallbladder should rather get better after antibiotics. So it is hardly possible that antibiotic itself has caused such issue. More possible is that your son has peptic ulcer which get irritated by antibiotic. In case of peptic ulcer, ultrasound is usually useless. I suggest your son to visit a doctor once again. CRP, and blood work should be done along with an ultrasound. If nothing will be found, gastrostomy should be next. Hope this will help. Regards."

This would result in a strong, bounding pulse that could also be asymmetric due to anatomic variation. Bounding pulse -commonly seen in hyperkinetic circulatory states where there is vasodilation and increased stroke output. The pulse volume is high (due to high pulse pressure) with increased blood flow. Hyperkinetic circulatory states may due to excitement/anxiety. Other causes of hyperkinetic circulatory states giving rise to bounding pulse are Hyperthyroidism, Severe anemia, Beri Berg (thiamine deficiency), Arterio-venous fistula (e.g. Pages disease or hepatic failure).

I should also mention that I am a smoker, and I smoke about 4-6 cigarettes a day!",
            "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are a active smoker, possibility of bronchitis is more for your symptoms. And you are not improving because you are not taking appropriate treatment for bronchitis. Bronchitis needs inhaled treatment. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

            "output": "Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor Ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. Cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. This causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. This causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. In you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks, I suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis, may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. Treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which I suppose you are already on. Usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. So ideally you must be on two blood thinners. If despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. However, higher blood thinners have a potential of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good healthRegards."

In view of all these symptoms started after prolonged abusive masturbation I think the prolonged masturbation has caused trivial damage to urethra resulting to form a scarring and flimsy stricture of urethra.

Sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does. Why is it that I no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again. I m beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this. Never ever had this issue before with any other partner. I m in my 40 s and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous (never have numerous partners). I m so over this please help me",
            "output": "Hello, Klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (HAI). They could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. In diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. Due to their particular structure, Klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, etcetera.). Often their treatment is possible only through the use of Carbapenems and Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, etcetera.). Klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. Recent studies have reported that recurrent Klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent Klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. Recurrent strains of Klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. Now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. The fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. In your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. You have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. Post-coital therapy, by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. You again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. Apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. You should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. It is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. Lastly, Klebsiella is not transmitted sexually, thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. But, during each intercourse, it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that Klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon).

A temporary coverin ws done but within days it came off and exposed tooth since then. I ws advised meftal - forte tablets to take for pain by a chemist. Please advice ASAP if i should take to subside the pain for now. Within 2 or 3 days i would be visiting a good dentist. Thank you!",
            "output": "Hello, I am glad to assist you. The temporary filling placed would be expected to wear away if only placed to cover the tooth while expecting you to return for a root canal therapy. The filling needs to be removed to enter the center of the tooth and clean out the canals to complete the root canal. You will have a temporary filling until the canals are sealed, and you can plan restorative treatment with your dentist. An antibiotic such as Amoxicillin may be necessary if pain and swelling is present. This will help control the spread of inflammation from the infected tooth. I usually recommend taking a combination of two Advil and two extra strength Tylenol to control a more severe pain until you are able to visit the dentist again. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you will feel relief soon."

            "input": "Hello. I kicked something and now my foot is slightly swollen, slightly bruised, but definitely sore. I cannot bend my big toe (which is the area where the pain originates, in the foot part just below my big toe) not because of the pain, but I physically cannot make it bend. It hurts to walk on the affected area but I can walk. I just cannot put weight on the big toe. It is painful with a mixture between dull and achy and suddenly sharp or throbbing. Though, I took a Vicodin and the pain is a lot better. The pain is more localized and the areas around it hurt less allowing me to put weight on those areas. Does this sound more like it could be a sprain since the pain medication helped with almost all of the pain aside from the milder pain I feel in the location of the bruise and swelling?",
            "output": "Dear patient You have injured your foot more so your great toe and possibility of fracture cannot be ruled out since pain is not relieved.  I would advise X-ray of involved foot anteroposterior and oblique views to confirm diagnosis.  If it shows fracture you need to consult expert orthopedic surgeon with report.  If its normal diagnosis is sprain and recommended treatment is rest for 2 weeks and tab diclofenac 50\u00a0mg twice a day for 5 days. All the best."

If the size of tumor is small (below 3 cm) it could be treated by Radiosurgery, if it is greater than 3 cm it needs surgery.Don't delay treatment because there is a serious risk of blindness.

            "output": "Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor! I am Infectious Disease Specialist! I went through your query! There are various causes of lymphadenopathy (Viral, bacterial, tubercular infection), lymphoma, leukemia, etc. You need thorough examination and set of investigations(ZN stain from FNAC and cytology) to come to diagnosis whether viral, bacterial or tubercular in nature. In your case as you have evening rise it is likely \"Tubercular\" in nature pulmonary or extra-pulmonary. But I recommend take a course of antibiotic for 2 weeks to see if it resolves before you get investigated for other causes. You will need antibiotic prescription. Happy to take more queries! You can also write a review for me. If you would like some more information, I will be happy to provide. Take care!"

The CT scan will give us some information about how your kidneys and gallbladder look. Are you having any white discharge per vagina which is contaminating the urine? Infection of the urinary tract is the most common cause of pus cells in the urine. Repeat the culture. If repeated cultures are negative and there is no kidney stone on CT scan, you will need tests to look for causes of Sterile Syria. Blood in stools is not due to gallstones nor urine infection - it needs further assessment. Most commonly it is due to hemorrhoids (piles), but a doctor (surgeon/ GP) should examine you to confirm or negate this."

Fever can be due to a viral or bacterial infection. Aside from the throat pain, does he have colds or cough? For most viral infections, the patients appear well after given antipyretic (fever medicine like Eugenic or Paracetamol) in between fever episodes. The throat infection caused by viruses is usually accompanied by colds. Viral infections are not given antibiotics like Azithromycin or Brian. It is mainly supportive like giving fever medicine, lots of fluids, antibacterial gargle. Fever caused by viral infections can last from 3 days to a week. After 3 days, you will notice the fever to go down and the patient will show improvement already. You may try to check his throat to see if the tonsils are red and swollen sometimes with streaks of pus. If you see this, chances are the throat infection is caused by a bacteria like streptococcus or what we call as the strep throat. Patients who have strep throat can also have severe headache, difficulty swallowing, sometimes with rashes. Bacterial throat infection will be more sick looking compared to that caused by viruses. For this you will need antibiotics that is properly computed based on your children weight. I hope I was able to help you. Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D. Pediatrics"

            "output": "Hi, Thank you for contacting us. I will to ad Chat Doctor.  The single most important thing to rule out here is an infection. Antibiotics are prescribed for bite wounds to prevent infection in certain situations. For example, if:1. You have been bitten by a cat. All cat bites are usually treated with antibiotics, as they are much more likely to get infected than dog bites.2. The bite wound is on an arm or leg - especially a hand. These sites are particularly prone to nasty infections that can cause severe damage after a dog or cat bite.3. The wound is large, deep or punctured. A puncture wound may not look large but may go deep into the tissues.4. Your injury needed an operation to clean it out, or repair the damage.5. Your resistance to infection is low. For example, if you are on chemotherapy; have no working spleen; have diabetes; have an immune system problem such as AIDS.6. You have an artificial heart valve (and sometimes, if you have an artificial joint). Antibiotics will also be prescribed if your wound has already become infected. It might be infected if:It is getting more painful rather than improving as time goes by. It has become red or swollen. It is oozing. Sometimes the doctors exam will discover some red lines in the skin of the arm - this is known as lymphangitis - this also needs antibiotics.

Whenever we start any antibiotic, the course should be completed even if you are feeling better before the course gets completed. The reason behind it is if you do not complete the course, the bacteria or infective agent develops resistant to the antibiotic which you didn't complete the course. And next time if you again get the infection by the same infective agent, the antibiotic won't work the next time, and you will need higher antibiotic.

In early stage if life expectancy is more (like more than 10 years or 5 years depending on additional criteria) radical treatment is offered.

If the above one doesn't fit your category than this should be just having weakness of the body and nothing else.

            "output": "Hello, It's not a good sign to have pain after getting an implant in our jaw. The pain can occur for a day or two but if it is prolonged it could be a sign of infection. However in your case, you mentioned you wear retainers- that is one of the possible cause of pain. You are not supposed to wear retainers for at least two weeks till the gums over the implant heal well. Or if it is too important then your retainers must be lined by a \"soft tissue liners\" which will prevent any trauma to the underlying gums when you wear the retainer. it's not a good idea to wear retainer in post surgical phase. Avoid for two weeks and consult your dentist. Let him do a clinical examination and take an x-ray of the area. Be cautious if you see \"pus\" coming out. that's a sign of infection. Must go back to your dentist and talk. Good luck. "

So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) with lung volumes and DCO. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis.

There is a curvilinear opacity overlaying the left upper quadrant seen only in the AP projection. While pathological calcification within the abdomen cannnot be excluded, this appearance is new from the prior study, decreasing the likelihood that this is a significant finding. This could reflect overlying artifact or bowel contents. A punctate opacity overlying the superior pole of the right kidney on the current view was noted to be projected more superiorly on the prior study and is likely a hepatic granuloma.

            "output": "Hello and Welcome to Chat Doctor, Thanks for writing to us. Vitamin E, known for its healing qualities, helps nourish skin and fade scars. Open a vitamin E capsule and apply gel directly to the scars twice a day until you see them start to fade, then apply once a day thereafter. Eat foods rich in vitamin K. These are good for your skin because vitamin K helps heal and protect skin from wounds and scars. Slice a fresh lemon and brush across your chicken-pox scars. Coat chicken-pox scars liberally in honey once a day. Rub raw garlic on your chicken-pox scars at night. If your scars are new, rub sandalwood oil on them. Do this for a few months, and you just might prevent your scar from setting in the first place. If your scars are very old, rub coconut oil on them every morning. Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health... Regards."

This helps for diagnostic purpose, to obtain the tissue for histopathological examination. And for therapeutic purpose. By doing D&C heavy bleeding can be decreased in next cycles. If the histopathological examination shows normal tissue, no need to worry. Once check for hormonal profile and thyroid profile. If you are having regular ovulation, there may not be any problem in getting pregnancy. Track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy.

As per your complaint Orthodontic Retainers are advised to maintain the changed teeth position after achieving proper alignment of teeth post completion of orthodontic treatment.

You might need a fixed orthodontic treatment followed by repeated wearing of the retainers. The orthodontist might also advise you removable orthodontic appliances for re-achievement of alignment.

Using the mouth wash thrice will not help as it may cause over usage and in turn stain the teeth. I would advise you to visit a periodontist in your area and get your teeth cleaned professionally and then use the mouth wash for a few days. Use the proper technique of brushing. Use a desensitizing paste for a while. Once the teeth are cleaned and maintained well, the recession and mobility may reduce. If still persistent recession, the periodontist will plan the next treatment for recession. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards."

            "output": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that due to hitting with a metal bar there has been soft tissue injury and due to injury there has been inflammation and swelling due to accumulation of inflammatory exudate and cells at the injury site. There also seems to be ruptured blood vessels leading to bruising and formation of a Hematoma. The movable gel like lump seems to be a Hematoma and is due to accumulation of blood from ruptured blood vessels. I would suggest you that you need not worry about it as it will resolve gradually. You can do alternate warm and cool compresses over the lump. You can also give him anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen. In case if there is pain numbing gel containing Lidocaine can also be advised. You can also apply Heparin gel over the area as it will help in faster disruption of the hematoma as well as bruising.

In my opinion you are having mostly HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), but better to rule out cardiac cause first for your symptoms. So get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal then no need to worry much for cardiac cause. It seems HERD more. Gaseous distension is also seen on HERD, and this is giving you bloating feeling of abdomen. GERD is because of laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this the acid of the stomach, tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of dull aching, burning central chest pain. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid stress and anxiety.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Start proton pump inhibitor.4. Go for walk after meals.5. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in bed."

It is called a duplicated collecting system meaning other than one tube Chat Doctor.  It will depend on if he has a complete duplication meaning he has two ureters(tube that connects the kidney to the urinary bladder) all the way from the kidney to the bladder or incomplete duplication where the two tubes will fuse somewhere in the middle and would have one insertion to the bladder. When we have a duplicated kidney we call the collecting system in the upper pole of the kidney upper moiety while the lower pole is the lower moiety. Prominence of the lower moiety means that it is more dilated than the upper pole. This means there might be some form of obstruction happening and should be investigated by CTS Can or MRI.

So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

These problems will not cause white spots on the gums, which are painless. Second thing and important thing in your query is you deal with a lot of stress daily. Because of that stress some kind of white spots which are pain less, may form not only on the gums but also on the entire mucosa of the oral cavity. I strongly suspect that white spots may be because of that stress. Anyhow you kindly visit the dentist one more time.

            "input": "I have a DVT factor 8, had this condition for 11 years. I have had pressure in my chest. I have a greenfeather filter. Today I went to the emergency room. They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary. I am 42 years of age female never smoked, been in great health. Now these items are coming up. I am scared these doctors are not finding what is wrong even with my condition. Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this?",
            "output": "Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems that the swelling of tongue that you have developed has nothing to do with the DVT and pressure in chest you are having. I agree with your doctor that it seems to be an allergic reaction. I would advise you to take Antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day for at least 5 days. If it was an allergic reaction, you should find immediate improvement in the swelling in 1-2 days. Otherwise, the cause is not allergic. The allergy could be due to anything that you have been exposed to through air, water or food. If the episodes are frequent, you should go for a blood test for allergy to find out what substance you are allergic to, and you can avoid exposure to that in the future. However, if the swelling does not decrease with the antihistamines or if it increases, then you should consult a dentist to examine the oral cavity and investigate further regarding the cause. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,"

Also, other hormonal disbalances due to menstruation cause nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue and abdominal swelling.  Girls who are younger when their periods start, who have longer periods or heavier blood flow and smoking are a risk factors for cramps. Heartburn can be related to this story, but also it can mean TAH you have some kind of gastric problems such as HERD, Ulcer/gastritis, so you should do gastrostomy to find the exactly what's going on. Use analgesics(nonsteroid) for pain relief because they decrease prostaglandin production in blood. To be sure that you're healthy do gynecology examination and pelvic ultrasound to check your uterus and ovaries and steroid hormone levels. Wish you good health, "

So for your symptoms, possibility of bladder scarring is more than bladder cancer. But biopsy is must differentiate between these two. So get done biopsy for the diagnosis. If it is scarring then treatment is available and your problem can be solved. But if it turned out to be malignant then you need to get done staging of the cancer.

            "input": "we were told our child may have abdominal migraines- both of this parents have regular migraines( headaches) and strong family history of headache migraines on both maternal and paternal sides.  One family member ( adult) has abdominal migraines.  Our child has what appears to be very strong episodes of nausea that can last for as long as six hours but usually around 1 to two hours.  nausea is in waves.  He gets extremely pale and says his cheeks feel numb and then sometimes his hands and arms do as well.. this can last as long as nausea sometimes.. I thought the tingling sensations might be panic related ( panics when the nausea is very bad) but GI doc said tingling should not last that long with panic.  He also has dark circles often with these and more recently has complained of back bothering him when he has these episodes.  He has had stomach cramping for two months now as well as the nausea but nausea is getting more severe... he had upper and lower scoping done and has been recently diagnosed with acid reflux for which he is taking 40 mg of prilosec in capsule form ( capsules poured out).  He has also been prescribed ondansetron for nausea ( which does not always seem real effective) also just started him on amitriptyline ( 10mg) just started last night.  had been hesitant to start him on the amitriptyline as the GI specialist said that with as severe and as long-lived as the nausea seemed, he wondered if it was maybe abdominal migraines and that the nausea would not be that long lasting with reflux alone.   So, my thought was if it was abdominal migraines, I wanted to monitor what he had eaten the days the nausea has been really bad.  The common thread I found for each day was caffeine and he loves iced  tea.  He has had six episodes of severe nausea, tingling etc in the last two weeks..... all lasting at least an hour if not more... He also urinates a lot and when he has these episodes and sometimes says he feels dizzy.  My main question is, if he continues to take the amitriptyline, is it then going to be difficult to diagnose him with abdominal migraines ( GI doc said if it is abdominal migraine, that is the med a Neurologist would prescribe).  Can reflux cause abdominal migraines or make them worse?    Looking back over the last couple months when this first started... he has been pale a lot ( looks sick)... we were pediatrician several times and were not to see specialist until next week but when he started losing weight specialist saw us sooner.  Son had difficulty eating at times the past couple of months due to feeling so nauseated and became thinner. and thinner.. trying to get him some relief he is absolutely miserable when he has these episodes.  Having nausea with headache migraines, I know how severe nausea can be... he does not cope with it well at all.  I take something at onset of headache migraines and feel good within a half hour... this is not happening for him...I really dont want him on meds for a long time but since migraines are so strong in our family, I am concerned this may be the case.  Do kids usually grow  out of these if it is abdominal migraine?  Could it be related to his hormones? He is 10 .  Concerned about side effects of med.... maybe things will subside when reflux clears up?  Thanks so much for any help you can provide!!!   Heartfelt thanks!!",
            "output": "With such presentations in my clinic, I would prescribe Comparison 1 tablet 3 times after 15 min before meals. It is gold standard for acid reflux. Kindly follow Partners diet 1, don't give him ice or other tea, it will increase acidity, avoid chocolate and cheese, it can cause migraine also. Begin to take flax seeds(boil 1 tbs in 2 glasses of water, take 1/2 glass before meal twice a day). Give him yogurts, probiotics(Similar), it will decrease nausea and increase appetite. For headache migraines you can use 1 tablet of Diclofenac and 1 tablet of Risperidone.  Hope this helps"

Although the diarrhea is not related to the head injury, napping more in a child of this age is difficult to judge or rule out to be due to the injury. If I were your doctor, I would have advised you to keep a close watch on her level of consciousness to see if she is responding normally to your routine talks with her, and if she is moving her limbs normally, and has not got any vomiting. The bump on her head is due to collection of blood by the injury, and will subside gradually. In case of any change in the level of consciousness of hers to your commands, and any increase in the bump on the head, I would advise you to take her to the ER room of the nearest hospital, where they would examine her closely and if considered necessary might go for some investigations like a CT scan to rule out any concealed head injury.

Based on your statement that you have posted the brown particle that you have passed in urine hours after ejaculating is likely to be a blood clot mixed with urine which gets turned up into brown color.

Since this is single episode and all the tests like C. T scan, X-ray and Cystoscopy did not reveal any pathological lesion you should not worry about it.

            "output": "Hello Allie, I am Kathy - a nutritionist- and I may be able to help you with thisNausea is a common side effect with iron supplements. There are other iron supplements that are gentler on the stomach, and you may want to discuss this with your doctor. I am assuming you are on iron because your iron is low. You can increase your iron naturally by eating high iron foods such as raises, spinach, molasses and, if you eat meat, red meat is high in iron. Eating a source of high vitamin C along with your iron will increase the amount of iron you absorb, so fruit, vegetables are naturally high in C as is vitamin C enriched juices. Iron should always be taken with food. From what it sounds like, you are not eating with it. Try taking it in the am with food (but not dairy or high fiber foods) and include a source of vitamin C with your iron supplement. Food does decrease absorption, but if the iron is making you nauseous, eat and/or ask to be switched to a gentler form of iron. In summary, take iron in am with food low in fiber and a source of vitamin C. Check with your doctor about these problems and see if there is a gentler form of iron you can take. Increase your iron in your blood naturally by including high iron foods. High iron foods should be combined with a source of vitamin C. Have a Great Day!"

Generally during fever, a bland diet, which is smooth and soothing, is preferred. Care should be taken while cooking food and also choosing foods that are easy to digest. Fluids in the form of tender coconut water, barley water, electrolyte fortified water, fresh fruit juice, vegetable soup, buttermilk and water can be given. Begin with semi-solid diet for a few days and then gradually include fruits like bananas, watermelons, grapes and peaches. As the appetite gets better, semi-solid to solid foods can be given. Boiled rice, baked potato, baked apple, yogurt, vegetable soup can be given. Gradually, by 3 to 4 weeks, normal diet can be restored. The following foods to be avoided:1. High fiber foods like whole grain cereals and their products like oatmeal, whole wheat bread and raw vegetables in the form of salads2. Vegetables like cabbage, capsicum and turnip as these can cause bloating and gas.3. Oily foods, spices and seasoning like pepper, cayenne and chili powder to prevent aggravation of inflammation of digestive tract. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."

In your wife there is a bright spot in the pectoral region therefore for it to be a cancer it should have grown aggressively over last 6 months with or without development of pain and. Most cancer appears like a lump in the chest and will be fixed to the chest wall. If it is bright on PET scan then it is not confirmed to be a cancer and biopsy is to be done to confirm it. There are other acute and chronic inflammatory conditions which might cause bright area on PET scan. PET scan is a technique by which the glucose metabolism is studied. Cancer cells and non cancer inflammatory cells might be seen on PET scan. It is suggested that in a 3.4 cm area the doctor does a CT guided biopsy and then the diagnosis is confirmed. If confirmed to be cancer then surgery is possible. Please do not worry."

You can in addition do culture and sensitivity from the organisms. MRSA has wide resistant pattern. So once we have sensitivity we can take the antibiotics accordingly. Please do not discontinue half treatment. As MRSA than never responds to half treated antibiotics. Once cured you have to clear the MRSA from the system. You can use mupirocin ointment to clear MRSA from the system. Apply it to the groin, umbilicus, nasal septum etc. After applications for a week you can do swab testing for MRSA from this area.

I recommend consulting with your gastroenterologist for a careful physical examination, an abdominal ultrasound, a stool analysis, some lab blood tests including: a complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, CEA, CA19.9 (tumor antigens), etc. A GI endoscopy is necessary to exclude possible lesions of the digestive tract if suspicions are raised.

Her bleeding has become better but her HB has fallen down a lot. I am really worried what to do. Should we go for a blood transfusion.",
            "output": "Dear patient. Greetings from Chat Doctor !!!  I am Chat Doctor and shall be answering your question. I can understand your reservations about blood transfusion and when it should be done. Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your question and guide you through the problem. Your sister has an HE of 3.5gm/DL. The normal HE for her is 12gm/DL. Her anemia can be multifactorial, blood loss due to fibroid, nutritional, menstrual loss. HE of 3.5gm/DL is a very low hemoglobin. The body goes into a state of high output cardiac failure and blood is not able to deliver enough oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen is a basic requirement of the cells. Hypoxia leads to accumulation of acids in the blood and the patient feels tired and breathless. Hence, I would recommend your sister be transfused with a total of 3 to 4 packed cells to get the HE till 7gm/DL. She can then be treated for the cause. She can then be given hepatitis, intravenous iron and treated for fibroid if any. Current day transfusions are safe and the risk of acquiring diseases is minimal. Hence, you shouldn't worry about that, I hope this helps you out. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to write back to me. Yours sincerely, ChatDoctor."

Short information about progress of weakness.*Explanation: My opinion is that high blood pressure on many occasions is an indication for control. That happens on many levels. First, be sure that high blood pressure is not secondary to any other diseases as Cushing or renal failure. Then, Diet with low salt and less fat content is crucial. Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that does not help, medications are a must. That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities. Some Chat Doctor. Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started. Weakness or neurological deficit in a hypertensive patient is a dangerous sign and need to be managed as soon as possible to avoid brain hemorrhage suggest my patients the following : lower blood pressure to a reasonable level, follow up conscious level and weakness. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other comorbidities like diabetes, hyperlipidemia etc., also you didn't mention the fate of weakness or investigations done.*Conclusion: I suggest you consult your physician about your aunt antihypertensive medications.

He just recently went to the doctor an they diagnosed him with having MS. However then sent him to a neurologist an he diagnosed him with Corticobasal ganglion degeneration I feel like he had a stroke an it went undiagnosed.",
            "output": "I read your question and I understand your concern. To be honest I am very puzzled by your story, especially the corticobasal ganglion degeneration (CBG) part. CBG typically presents around the age of 60. The youngest ever documented case has manifested at the age of 34 (I rechecked before answering just to be sure). So if your son had that disease at 38 with manifestations starting at 35, he would be an almost unique case in the history of the disease, I would be really careful in taking that diagnosis. As for the distinction between MS and stroke related to the head trauma it should generally be easy with an MRI if history and examination do not already make that distinction. Without knowing more about the signs and MRI report it's hard for me to say something more because these diseases can have many presentations. The seizure would direct more towards the head trauma rather than MS, as would the fact that the deficit has remained constant in time since the hit, without new signs, as you seem to suggest, but as I said MRI and more details are needed. I hope things work out for the best."

But the other day which this has happened a few times my left fore arm locked up while washing my hair it hurt and also was numb my concern is could this be a sign of a heart attack or stroke?",
            "output": "Hi dear, When a herniated disc occurs, it can release pressure on nearby spinal nerves and the spinal cord, causing unpleasant painful symptoms, very common ones are neck pain, radiating arm pain, shoulder pain, and numbness or tingling in the arm or hand. Pain by patients are general explained as dull, aching, and difficult to localize to sharp, burning, and easy to pinpoint. Pain in your arms as well as in your neck is usually the first sign that your nerve roots are irritated by a problem in your neck. Symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and especially weakness in the muscles of your arms, are warning signs that your problem may be more serious. Weakness in your arms is a definite sign that you should see a doctor about your neck pain. So i don't think it's a heart attack sign neither a stroke. Not all patients with herniated disc require surgery. Patient can find symptomatic relief through non-surgical therapies such as exercise, medication, physiotherapy. I will really advise you to meet your consulting doctor for further management and proper treatment.I may also feel from your questing that this problem has limited your life/daily work to some degree, I can give you my honest opinion that in my clinical practice I have seen attest 95 % patient getting relief from physiotherapy and conservative management.I hope you will carry on with the treatment .TAKE CARE."

I would like to say about few lines for psoriasis.... Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing and autoimmune disease. There may be scaly plaques on various parts of the body, scaly lesions on the scalp and sometimes joint pain may be there due to politic arthritis. Exact cause is not known. Genetic tendency, autoimmunitity, stress, Chat Doctor. .etc. may be responsible for precipitation and exacerbation of the disease. You did not say what treatment you took for lichen sclerosis. If your doctor has given oral steroids or steroid injections for lichen sclerosis.that would have worsened the psoriasis. I do not believe that daily bath is responsible. I usually recommend cap accretion 10 mg twice a day along with methotrexate 15 mg weekly in three decided doses 12 hourly. This may be taken for long time till good response. Blood tests may be done to monitor the treatment. Apply mild steroid cream or calcitriol point on the lesions. For scalp psoriasis, tar shampoo may be done. You may apply moisturizer to improve the skin texture. Avoid soap bath for few weeks. Avoid stress and worries as that might worsen psoriasis. I hope you got my answer. Thanks."

It seems that you've lost nearly all the weight you gained during the pregnancy, so mechanical causes of back pain are probably less likely.  Still a good examination to distinguish different types of back pain including the possibility of chronic pain following the c-section is worthwhile and can help identify even other causes of chronic low back.  Psychological stressors causing back, shoulder, and neck pain are very common and even physical stressors such as working on computers without proper back/neck support or not taking frequent enough breaks, or being tensed in the shoulders and arms while typing constantly can play into the picture.  In short, a number of potential causes can be in play.  A good physical examination by a good physician with proper imaging studies and other workup will do a lot of elucidate the root of your problem. Hope I have answered your query.

According to your description, there is almost nil possibility to have traumatic injury causing erectile dysfunction in your case. Let me know whether you achieve and maintain an erection in sleep, in the early morning or during masturbation then there is no need to be worried about. It is likely due to performance anxiety. For continuous erection, there must be constant erotic/romantic thoughts, feelings, and sensations in your mind. If your mind is diverted to concern about erection, you will lose erection or have delayed or no erection. This failure causes you worried more during next time and again makes you focusing on your erection rather than enjoying erotic feelings. You may read Senate focus on internet.

            "output": "Laparoscopy is a surgery that uses a thin, lighted tube put through a cut in the belly to look at the abdominal organs or the female pelvic organ. Laparoscopy is used to find problems such as cysts, adhesions, fibroid and infection. Tissue samples can be taken for biopsy through the tube. In many cases laparoscopy can be done instead of laparotomy surgery that uses a larger incision in the belly. Laparoscopy can be less stressful and may have fewer problems and lower costs than laparotomy for minor surgeries. It can often be done without needing to stay overnight in the hospital. Laparoscopy is done to check for and possibly take out abnormal growths such as tumors in the belly or pelvis, check for and treat conditions such as endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease, find conditions that can make it hard for a woman to become pregnant, do a biopsy, to look whether cancer in another area of the body has spread to the belly, check for damage to internal organs, such as the spleen, after an injury or accident, do a tubal ligation, fix a hiatus hernia or an inguinal hernia, removal of organs, such as the uterus, spleen, gallbladder, ovaries and appendix. Partial removal of the colon can also can be done and also to find the cause of sudden or ongoing pelvic pain. Risks include bleeding from the incisions, infection and damage to an organ or blood vessel. This may cause more bleeding that needs another surgery to repair."

My quad on that leg has never really come fully back to the size of the other leg. I have an office job, so I m relatively inactive during the day usually, but have had the last 2 weeks off as holiday and have been more active moving some furniture, fixing things around the house, some home improvement and a bit of gardening. This morning I woke IP with a round, painless bruise on my kneecap, near the top inner edge. My knee does grind a little at full extension, but that happens quite a lot anyway. Over the past week, the quad muscle on the affected side has grown and become more responsible, but is still smaller than the other side. The knee is reasonably painful during stress and occasionally hits a big bit of pain when extending under load.",

To rule out we must go for X-ray. Another cause may be due to continuously repeated heavy work, your qua Chat Doctor.  You should walk regularly do cycling swimming running jogging, if the pain is subsiding it means your thigh muscles were weak, or else you need to take an x-ray for the knee joint.

Assuming that you are a student, it is unlikely that you have a refractory error (near vision problems are usually seen in middle age). Association with studies almost rules out other causes like sinusitis and migraine.  When mind is forced to do what it does not like, it will react in such a way that you have difficulty doing it. Headache, decreased concentration and forgetfulness are some problems commonly seen in students. High expectation from self and others only add to the burden. Following points may help you overcome this problem:1. Take frequent breaks in between study sessions2. Make the Studying process interesting (like group discussion, audiovisual aids etc.)3. Take help for difficult subjects(coaching/tuition)4. Plan well to manage time. Remember, \"Failing to plan is planning to fail\""

Chest pain and coughing up mucus so went to the doctor who said i had pharyngitis. 2 weeks after and still coughing i developed really sore ribs especially when laughing, coughing, sneezing deep breathing and lying down in bed. Went to the doctor who said it was the intercostal muscles and gave me pain relief and an inhaler due to shortness of breath. 2 weeks later due to not breathing properly i developed a chest infection given anti biotics. After a month of pain relief and still not much relief she wondered whether the pain relief (diclofenac) was causing reflux making the cough worse so prescribed some tablets to go along with it. The night time cough did disappear. Rib pain is still present when deep breathing especially when exercising. A week ago i really overdone it strenously walking and then 3 days ago developed a cough, that is progressivley getting worse. Last night it caused throat pain whilst coughing and a feeling of a lump in my throat and struggling to breathe took my inhaler and it actually relieved it all.

Before ejaculation I let go and ejaculated like normal, but felt an odd somewhat dull pressure/pain on the dorsal surface of my penile shaft about 1 inch above the base (traveling in the direction of my penis, i.e. not horizontal/diagonal). At the area of the pain was now a hardened cord with a bit of a bump at the middle of the cord. It is not visible but can be palpated. It seemed like my penis took longer to become flaccid after that. I stopped any masturbation and let it rest for a week. It seemed nearly better but masturbating very gently caused it to return somewhat. I have gone a bit more than a week without masturbation now but want to check that something like this will go away and not be any long term damage. I still feel a dull pain at the area at times when the penis is flaccid. No issues with erections or ejaculation. Is this a lymph or vein issue?

Agin asked for Contrast CT. and the result shows that the nodule grew to size of 2.6 cm. and am asked for bronchoscopy again.

            "output": "This is likely a growth of some sort, whether it is benign or malignant (cancer) can only be definitively determined on a biopsy. The fact that it has not grown much over 4 years makes it more likely to be benign, and would only require follow-up imaging. When there is enough concern for malignant tumors (for example if there is fast growth, or you have an extensive smoking history), the nodule would need to be surgically resected. If you are having other symptoms such as fevers and chills, then your doctor can evaluate you for an infectious granuloma being the cause of this nodule. TB (tuberculosis) or fungal infections of the lungs can do this. I hope this gives you some of the answers you were looking for."

So, they may not be effective in preventing the ovulation in the very first month.

The tissue you saw could have been the expelled fertilized ovum. Also, heavy bleeding and delayed periods are common in the initial few months. If your period had been a little delayed following the hormone shot, then the tissue could be endometrium which is thickened when there is delayed period.

            "output": "Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium with occasional pericardial effusion. About 90% of the causes are unknown. Most people will have viral type symptoms such as fever, myalgic, and malaise. Pericarditis can also cause cute, sharp, stabbing chest pain that can last hours to days. Some people will also get shortness of breath and pain with breathing. I am assuming you had a pretty extensive work up before being diagnosed with pericarditis. The work up should've included blood work with inflammatory markers and cardiac markers, as well as EKG changes. The first line treatment is usually ibuprofen several times daily for about two weeks. There are other anti-inflammatories that work just as good if you cannot tolerate ibuprofen. Steroids are actually a second line treatment but work just as good as ibuprofen. Generally, about 7 to 10 days of ibuprofen can significantly decrease your symptoms and pericarditis. You should also get plenty of rest.  Some people have will have recurrent pericarditis. You should also have an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there is no fluid around the heart. If you do not get better with ibuprofen in 10 days, I would recommend having a further work up to make sure you do not have my own pericarditis which involves the heart muscle."

Additionally, she seems to be having symptoms similar to a urinary tract infection - burning and constant feeling to urinate. Is that a symptom involved with gall stones or the removal thereof? And to add more to all of it, she has been having diaherra for over 2 months. Her doctor precribed her medications for this which help when she remembers to take them, but it seems to be an ongoing issue for her - even more so after the surgery. I m worried that my grandmother may have some other issues going on that the doctors haven t found yet. Can you help shed some light on any of this? Thank you!",

It is more possible reinfection which is common in people that underwent any surgical procedure since their immune system is weakened few weeks after surgery. She should treat it by taking the lot of fluids and antibiotic if necessary. Diarrheas may be experienced after gallbladder surgery but it shouldn't last for more than 2-3 months. If there is no improvement she may need gastroenterologist work up to rule out some bowel disorders. Thanks for the query. Regards"

            "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to tell you that the antibiotics you took in the first pack should not interfere with the birth control you took, and the fact that you got a normal period on time means you do not have to worry about pregnancy. Missing two or more pills in a row usually causes some breakthrough bleeding a few days after the missed pills, even if you make them up.  This is the bleeding you are experiencing now.  It most likely will stop eventually, but may continue until you finish this pack. You maximize the possibility of stopping the spotting by trying to take your pills at the same time every day.  A way you can help remember your daily pill is to take it at the same time as some routine activity you do every day, for example brushing your teeth, or having a morning coffee.  Carrying your pills in your purse all the time can also help if you do not consistently stay in the same place every night.

This part is below the heart and gravity contributes to this also. In addition, she may be having a partial block of the veins which take the blood away from the legs.  She sits a lot which is not good and should walk around and use elastic stockings which help this to some extent. Another important thing is a check-up by your doctor to see if the veins affected are the deep ones or those near the skin. Medication will be needed for this. Keep the legs elevated while sitting, and she may do ankle foot exercises to aid in pumping of the blood. You are most welcome and hope this is useful for your mother. Please take this advice free"

I had a radical prostatectomy and have subsequently been treated at MD Anderson with intermittant lupron and casodex. My present condition is extremely good and has been so since surgery. On my most recent restaging and evaluation (Sept 2012) the term malignant neoplasm of prostate was included as an alert notice. I did not read this note until just recently. I am wondering if this indicates a change in my diagnosis, or has this terminology been relevant from day one?",
            "output": "Hi, Your prostate cancer risk stratification should be mentioned. You should mention your baseline PSA value before treatment and staging based on pathology report. As your Gleason score was 10 most probably your disease was high risk prostate cancer. In this case adjuvant radiation may have some role (pelvic radiation). Anyway it is not clear whether radiotherapy was given or not. Now you have to check your PSA value at regular interval. As radical prostatectomy has been done then PSA value more than 0.2 NG/ml may indicate biochemical failure. Then your treatment can be changed. Another issue you have to know whether at any time your PSA value came below 0.03 NG/ml or not. This has got prognostic implication. Prostate cancer and malignant neoplasm of prostate are synonymous.

The reason of lower abdominal pain with back pain for 4 months can be the following :Pelvic inflammatory disease - Endometriosis. Diseases of the ovaries and / tubesEnteritisColitisMyometritis. As the Caesarion section was 18 months ago, this may not be related to the present problems. The medicines given by Her Gynecologists are based on the reports, which you say OK. Gynecologist must have done an internal examination and thought of PID or Endometriosis as a major cause hence gave the medicines. Also, must have thought about anxiety or stress hence added few more medicines like trypromer and so. I think these are good medicines but if they are not helping, we have to think about other causes. In such a case I would advise the following:CT scan of the abdomenDiagnostic Laparoscopy has a major role to play and this is a common practice now. It allows the direct visualization of the whole abdomen, its contests, particularly, uterus, tubes and ovaries in this case. Hence, the diagnosis m biopsy and treatment can be undertaken in many patient.

However, from your history, I would like to suggest you as follows:1. Most important thing - allergy testing is not 100% to identify the cause, especially in cases of long-term urticaria like yours. So although you have been tested positive for a few food substances, personally I would suggest you to observe your food and correlate with urticaria. If urticaria does not appear within 2-3 hours of taking a food item, even if it is tested positive, you may start eating it gradually. You may not be really allergic to that particular food item.2. I would like to know whether you take any other medicines regularly. Particularly analgesics like ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc. can cause urticaria. In that case, please contact your physician who will suggest you alternative Chat Doctor. 3. Were I treating you, I would suggest you a short course of antiparasitic treatment with nitazoxanide or albendazole. Many times, intestinal parasites also can cause chronic urticaria.4. Personally I would suggest you investigations like complete blood count, ESR, CRP, Thyroid function tests, Urine and stool routine & microscopic examination. These may give clue to cause of your urticaria symptoms.5. For treatment, till the cause is found, I would suggest you to continue taking an antihistamine like HY"

            "output": "HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern. Generally, fingering cannot result in a pregnancy. Also, pre ejaculatory fluid can lead to pregnancy at times, however you have not mentioned if any penetrative vaginal sex occurred. Sperm cannot survive outside in the hostile environment for 5 minutes, according to me, the chances of a pregnancy resulting from the encounter described are next to nil. If there was no vaginal penetration, then pregnancy cannot occur. However, if you are very concerned, you can still ask her to take ECP (emergency contraceptive pill) as a precautionary measure. When taken within 120 hours of unprotected sex, it is more than 80 % effective in guarding against a pregnancy. The expected period can be advanced or postponed for almost a week, after taking the Echo there is no way to predict the next date of her period. To be on the safer side, if you think there was some chance of a pregnancy please take a pregnancy test 4 weeks after the episode occurred. All the betake care."

I would advise you the following:- Get clinical evaluation and physical examination done by a General Surgeon and get investigated accordingly. - CT scan of the abdomen can tell if there is a chance of cancer of the cervix as you had undergone partial hysterectomy.- Pain in the vaginal area can be due to low estrogen you have.- Pain in the chest and breast on fire feeling can be due to Barrett's esophagus, needs regular follow-up with upper GI Endoscopy to see that it is not progressed to become a cancer or so. If required you may have to go for CT scan of the chest too. I hope this answer helps you to get a proper diagnosis as you have multiple problems and that they may not be related."

My entire spine and neck is very sore, nerve problems and no doubt my spine would be out in lots of places. A few weeks ago i started getting pains in my throat, like pain coming from the top of my chest just below my collar bones and traveling up my two neck two arteries. It isnt constant, but is there daily and comes and goes. Its in direct line with where the worst part of my back is, just below my collarbone line. That level is where my back is just beyond sore, words cant describe how bad it gets and i know my spine is out of place badly there. Now at the front at the exact same level is where im getting the pains from that are shooting into my throat. I know that pains like that can be heart related, but i feel fine apart from my back pain, my heart feels okay. Im just wondering can severe back pain and having a spine out of place cause such problems like this at the front. It just feels very tight and i get shooting pains going into my throat, but theres no real trouble breathing, just the usual tightness i feel with my spine being out and being very painful. If i honestly thought it was my heart and i had no trouble at all with back or neck pain, id be at the hospital right now. I just honestly dont feel its my heart and i know how ridiculous my back feels right now with the pain im in. Im only 35, so i dont think its a heart attack or stroke or anything and i have no tingling or numbness or anything in my arms/hands.

The pain at the back and in the spine does not come to the front just below the collar bone. The pain you are having in front and at the back are two separate pains. If I was your treating physician I will do the following:1. Take detailed assessment of your mood and anxiety. Sometimes such pains are associated with depression and anxiety disorder. Treating depression/anxiety improves the outcome of pain as well. 2. Get your x-ray spine done. 3. Examine the throat and chest for any abnormality.4. Get an ECG done.5. Consider starting antianxiety and pain modulating medicines. I hope this helps you.2."

By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis and allergy related symptom is more rather than heart related.

Midostaurin is a promising medicine and is under multiple research and treatment trials. If your husband is getting this medicine then let him continue taking it under the recommendation of his doctor. It is considered effective for a type of cancer called systemic mastocytosis. The promotion of limiting merciless in some sections of media is misrepresented. Just like midostaurin, limiting merciless is the name of another medicine which was in trials some time back. This medicine was not totally curative for all blood cancers but under research for certain blood cancer types. Unfortunately due to public ignorance, this was made in to a news report and mail and circulated among unintended sections of society. It is important not to get misled by such details.

If it is secondary to gallstones and your symptoms are occurring frequently and increasing in severity, it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. What you have is chronic cholecystitis, probably secondary to cholelithiasis (gallstones). The most important thing to take note here is that an elective or scheduled cholecystectomy has better post-operative outcomes and less risk of developing complications as compared to the one done emergently. Diagnostics (such as ultrasound, liver function tests, blood count, etc.) and management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Definitive treatment for gallstones is cholecystectomy or surgical removal of the gallbladder along with the stones. It can be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique.

He advised me to just continue to watch it and return in 3 months for reevaluation. I am trying to recall the name that he used to identify this spot. (something like Phibolist) He said it was a calcium deposit similar to a kidney stone. Do you possibly know the name of this stone?",
            "output": "Sialoliths may be the name mentioned to you. Have you been told that your salivary gland duct is blocked? Calcium deposits under the tongue are not uncommon. Your salivary flow is important to the health of your mouth. Salivary flow reduction can cause Chat Doctor.  Wharton's Duct is located under the tongue. You can try to stimulate the flow of saliva by sucking on something sour such as a lemon. Increased flow can push out calcium deposits and prevent the need for surgical removal. A Phlebolith, by definition, is a calcification in a vein or blood vessel. Vascular malformations may present with these. Sometimes, although present at birth, these may become prominent or increase later in life.  Swelling may become evident. The phlebitis may be seen on an x-ray. Additional studies including ultrasound and MRI may be required to determine vessel involvement. Hematomas are common with swelling, but less common with a phlebolith association in the mouth."

Does not seem to be helping me much. are there any MD doctors in Australia who can help? Could increase in dose of these tabs help or some injections or tonic. Thanks.",
            "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Thank you for your query. A Hemoglobin level of 5, indicates anemia. The Ferro-f-tab has been prescribed to correct this. But in clinical practice a hemoglobin level of 5 would require blood transfusion for proper correction. Iron tablets do help, but usually take a long period of time and are mostly prescribed when there is border-line anemia. I suggest you discuss the possibility of a blood transfusion with your medical care provider. I hope I have succeeded in answering your questions, you could write back to us anytime for further clarifications. Best wishes."

            "output": "Hello, First, having sex within 5 days after ending period is very much safe but using condom has near about 14% failure rate. Though, it depends on fertile period or ovulation time. On the other hand, 1-7 days period date alteration is normal thing and mostly occurs due to hormonal imbalance and stress/ mental upset. Therefore, I suggest her to wait at least 7 days to get normal period and if she does not get it, then she must undergo one home pregnancy test initially and later one blood test for beta-ChatDoctor to confirm or exclude pregnancy. Following test reports, consult with your doctor for next line of management. In the meantime, she must take balanced diet, avoid stress, Chat Doctor.  Be well & always practice safe sex."

If you have mugs from many years and recently develop lytic lesion and some lump then you have very high chance of developing multiple myeloma.

A small amount of weight loss can correct the hormonal imbalance. Leaving smoking helps.  - Hormonal imbalance can be controlled with Cyclical oral contraceptives.  - Medicines like Metformin, Camphene are tried to stimulate ovulation - If nothing helps, surgical Chat Doctor.  * For this you should approach a gynecologist & after pathological tests.

The cause of the same depends on the reason why mitral valve repair was done. Generally the possibilities are 1) Higher lung pressure causing right valve leak, dilatation or decreased pumping 2) The repair has lived its time as its 7 years, and the disease might have progressed 3) Any new mitral disease 4) In previous era, tricuspid valve was not repaired even if it had moderate to severe disease considering its self healed after mitral repair.  So the same may have progressed 5) Fall in function of left beret post mitral repair. There can be Hun Chat Doctor.  The treatment for the same is based on etiology. Regards "
